What is the difference between symmetric and asymmetric encryption? Symmetric encryption uses the same key for encryption and decryption, and asymmetric encryption uses two different keys, a public key and a private key

Explain the steps of the encryption and decryption process Encode “plaintext” into “ciphertext,” the use of cryptographic mathematical models are algorithms.First use the decryption key, numbers or a password also created by an algorithm.

Why is it important that you never share your secret key? A private needs to always be secure, if the public portion can be distributed to other users in the system. If a hacker had acces to a private key, he could use it impersonate a user and get access to a system.
